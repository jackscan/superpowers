# Writing Plans

## Overview

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.

Assume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan."

**Context:** Before execution, the workspace should be prepared via the `superpowers:preparing-workspace` skill — clean tree and baseline tests verified.

**Save plans to:** `docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`
- (User preferences for plan location override this default)

## Scope Check

If the spec covers multiple independent subsystems, it should have been broken into sub-project specs during brainstorming. If it wasn't, suggest breaking this into separate plans — one per subsystem. Each plan should produce working, testable software on its own.

## File Structure

Before defining tasks, map out which files will be created or modified and what each one is responsible for. This is where decomposition decisions get locked in.

- Design units with clear boundaries and well-defined interfaces. Each file should have one clear responsibility.
- You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more reliable when files are focused. Prefer smaller, focused files over large ones that do too much.
- Files that change together should live together. Split by responsibility, not by technical layer.
- In existing codebases, follow established patterns. If the codebase uses large files, don't unilaterally restructure - but if a file you're modifying has grown unwieldy, including a split in the plan is reasonable.

This structure informs the task decomposition. Each task should produce self-contained changes that make sense independently.

## Task Right-Sizing

A task is the smallest unit that carries its own test cycle and is worth a
fresh reviewer's gate. When drawing task boundaries: fold setup,
configuration, scaffolding, and documentation steps into the task whose
deliverable needs them; split only where a reviewer could meaningfully
reject one task while approving its neighbor. Each task ends with an
independently testable deliverable.

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement the minimal code to make the test pass" - step
- "Run the tests and make sure they pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with this header:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]

## Global Constraints

[The spec's project-wide requirements — version floors, dependency limits,
naming and copy rules, platform requirements — one line each, with exact
values copied verbatim from the spec. Every task's requirements implicitly
include this section.]

---
```

## Task Structure

````markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: [what this task uses from earlier tasks — exact signatures]
- Produces: [what later tasks rely on — exact function names, parameter
  and return types. A task's implementer sees only their own task; this
  block is how they learn the names and types neighboring tasks use.]

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

```python
def test_specific_behavior():
    result = function(input)
    assert result == expected
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

- [ ] **Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

```python
def function(input):
    return expected
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
````

## No Placeholders

Every step must contain the actual content an engineer needs. These are **plan failures** — never write them:
- "TBD", "TODO", "implement later", "fill in details"
- "Add appropriate error handling" / "add validation" / "handle edge cases"
- "Write tests for the above" (without actual test code)
- "Similar to Task N" (repeat the code — the engineer may be reading tasks out of order)
- Steps that describe what to do without showing how (code blocks required for code steps)
- References to types, functions, or methods not defined in any task

## Remember
- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in every step — if a step changes code, show the code
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Self-Review

After writing the complete plan, look at the spec with fresh eyes and check the plan against it. This is a checklist you run yourself — not a subagent dispatch.

**1. Spec coverage:** Skim each section/requirement in the spec. Can you point to a task that implements it? List any gaps.

**2. Placeholder scan:** Search your plan for red flags — any of the patterns from the "No Placeholders" section above. Fix them.

**3. Type consistency:** Do the types, method signatures, and property names you used in later tasks match what you defined in earlier tasks? A function called `clearLayers()` in Task 3 but `clearFullLayers()` in Task 7 is a bug.

If you find issues, fix them inline. No need to re-review — just fix and move on. If you find a spec requirement with no task, add the task.

## Handoff Document

After the plan and self-review are complete, generate a handoff document as a temporary scratch file. This carries the "why" and "watch out for" context that the spec and plan don't capture — the planning orchestrator's distilled summary of what it learned, not a transcript.

**Save to:** `.superpowers/execution-handoff.md` — a single, fixed, gitignored scratch path. This overwrites any previous handoff; exactly one handoff exists at a time. `finishing-work` deletes it when execution completes. It never enters git (`.superpowers/` is already in `.gitignore`).

**Template:**

````markdown
# [Feature Name] — Planning Handoff

> This document bridges planning and execution. Read this first, then the plan. It is a temporary scratch file, deleted when execution completes.

**Plan:** docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
**Spec:** docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-design.md

## Key Decisions

[3-7 bullet points: the non-obvious choices made during planning and why.
Each decision gets one line on what was chosen and one on why.]

## Rejected Alternatives

[2-5 entries: approaches considered and rejected, with a one-line reason.
Prevents the execution session from re-deriving paths already ruled out.]

## Planning Insights

[Context the spec and plan don't capture: gotchas discovered during
codebase exploration, fragile areas to watch, implicit assumptions,
environment quirks. Prose, not steps.]

## Execution

Two execution skills are available — choose one and start a new session:

1. **superpowers:subagent-driven-development** — dispatches a fresh
   subagent per task with review between tasks. Best for plans with
   mostly independent tasks.
2. **superpowers:executing-plans** — executes tasks inline in the
   current session with checkpoints.

Start a new session and give it this prompt:
"Load the plan-execution-entry skill."
````

**Generation:** Distill this from the planning conversation. The handoff doc is always written after the plan is finalized. If the plan is revised, regenerate the handoff doc — writing to the fixed scratch path always overwrites the previous handoff.

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan and handoff document, present the handoff message:

**"Plan and handoff document saved:**
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/<filename>.md`
- Handoff (scratch): `.superpowers/execution-handoff.md`

**Recommended: Start a new session for execution.** The planning phase
accumulated context that the execution orchestrator doesn't need. A
fresh session starts with just the plan, spec, and handoff context.

Start a new session and give it this prompt:
`Load the plan-execution-entry skill.`

The entry skill reads `.superpowers/execution-handoff.md`, which
points at the plan and spec, asks you which execution approach to use,
and loads the chosen skill. The execution skill, via `finishing-work`,
deletes the scratch handoff when work completes — the handoff never
persists in the repo.

**Alternatively**, you can stay in this session and load an execution
skill directly — but your context will carry the planning
conversation, which costs tokens without benefiting execution."
